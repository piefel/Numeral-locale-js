Numeral-locale.js
=======================================================

A JavaScript library for formatting and manipulating numbers.

This is a fork of [Numeral.js](http://numeraljs.com/) by Adam Draper. I do not believe in
_unformatting_ and _automatic currency_, and Adam does not agree on my insistence of using
[BCP-47](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) format.


Changelog
=========

### 1.0.0

Initial release as a fork of the 1.4.8 version. Added _locale_ handling which replaces
_language_. Use BCP-47 for locale files. Removed unformatting and currency.

Acknowlegements
===============

Numeral.js, while less complex, was inspired by and heavily borrowed from [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com)

This Numeral-locale.js is a fork of [Numeral.js](http://numeraljs.com/).
